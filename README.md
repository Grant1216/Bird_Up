## Additonal Documentation 
In future projects you will want to include additional information and documentation relevant to ones project. This allows others to follow along and understand how you came to the specific outcome. 

## Versioning
In future projects it is also important to include not only what software you are using, but also the version. There are many differences in versions of coding/analytic languages and softwares. Important that others know what was specifically used.
